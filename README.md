SFSourcer 

# Description

SFSourcer is an app with an epic purpose, to provide a one-stop shop for enthusiasts of speculative fiction. The app's current working features are Fanvorites, in which users build a community database of favorite speculative fiction authors, works, and genres; Living Story, in which users begin and develop a story in real time; Funding Projects, which is a crowdsourcing program to fund projects in the SF realm; Writer Groups, a forum for new authors to have their work reviewed and review the work of others. 

Those who complete the app signup, authenticated through email registration with a password, or through Facebook, may view, edit and update authors, works, and genres in Fanvorites, they may fund or create a new funding project, create a new writer group, join a writer group (under construction), add work to be reviewed to writer groups, or give feedback on other writer's works. These and several other anticipated features are shown in the navbar throuhout the app's pages.

Validations prevent users from adding blank records and adding to the database without being logged in. Much of the functionality included in the Writer Groups feature is rendered through Javascript Model Objects.

To run the app, follow these steps:

Fork and clone this repo.
cd to the directory from the terminal.
In the terminal run bundle install to install all required gems.
Migrate and seed the database.
Run the program on an ssl-enabled browser.
