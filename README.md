SFSourcer 

# Description

SFSourcer is an app whose current features are Fanvorites, in which users build a community database of favorite speculative fiction authors, works, and genres; and Living Story, in which users begin and develop a story in real time. Those who complete the app signup, authenticated through email registration with a password, or through Facebook, may add and update authors, works, and genres. Anyone may view all authors in the database as well as information about specific authors, works and related genres. Validations prevent users from adding blank records and adding to the database without being logged in. 

To run the app, follow these steps:

Fork and clone this repo.
cd to the directory from the terminal.
In the terminal run bundle install to install all required gems.
Migrate and seed the database.
Run the program on an ssl-enabled browser.
