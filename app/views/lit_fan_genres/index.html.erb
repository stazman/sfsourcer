<p>Planned Sidebar: Genres can be points of great contention among SF fans. Feel free to discuss the genres shown in works and authors found on SFSourcer Fanvorites and others. A way for genres to be changed/added to existing genres for a work, likely based on member voting, will be made possible in the future.</p>
