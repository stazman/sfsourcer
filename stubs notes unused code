'associating a new pledge with a current_user'




'building pledgescontroller and views'


To Do:

[  ] Make sure all validations work
[  ] Make sure login works
[  ] Finish Facebook signup
[  ] Add custom writer to show which pledges are subject to be withdrawn by funding_project creator, when funding goal is 90% met (money isn't withdrawn until funding goal is met)
[  ] Add JS snippet to prevent backsies
[  ] Make admin privleges; only admin can delete a project
[  ] Refactor to include navbar: Log In, Home, Your Profile



Unused Code:
