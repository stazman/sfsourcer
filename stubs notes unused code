'building pledgescontroller and views'


To Do:

[  ] Make sure all validations work
[  ] Finish Facebook signup
[  ] Add custom writer to show which pledges are subject to be withdrawn by funding_project creator, when funding goal is 90% met (money isn't withdrawn until funding goal is met)

[  ] Refactor to include navbar: Log In, Home, Your Profile
